                        </br/><h4>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)</h4>
                        <ol>MACD shows how two moving average prices relate. It is calculated by subtracting the 26 day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12 day EMA. 
                        Plotted on top of THE MACD is a 9 day EMA of the MACD triggers buy and sell signals. <br/>
                        <br/>The MACD can be interpreted in the following ways:<br/><br/>
                        <li><b>Crossovers:</b> If MACD falls below the signal line, it could be a sign to sell. If it goes above, then the price is likely to rise.
                        Many people chose to wait until the cross over the signal line before making a decision. </li>
                        <li><b>Divergence:</b> When security moves away from the MACD, the trend is at an end.</li>
						<li><b>Dramatic Rise: </b>When the MACD rises dramatically, security is overbought and will soon return to normal.</li>
                        <br/>Learn more about MACD <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp?ad=dirN&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&qsrc=0&o=40186">here</a>.</ol>
                        <h4>Bollinger Bands速</h4>
                        <ol>Bollinger Bands速 have a centre line which is an exponential moving average, along with two price channels above and below it.
                        It represents a moving average by adding and subtracting a standard deviation, which is a mathematical formula that measures volatility and shows how the stock price deviates from it's true value.
                        Bollinger Bands速 adjust to market conditions and are an asset to any trader due to the fact that they can find most of the price data between the two price channels.
                        When the prices reach the bottom channel, the stocks are oversold and the buyer can buy at a low cost and profit when the price moves up toward the centre line.
                        When the prices are near the upper channel, that means the stocks are overbought and the buyer is not recommended to buy at this time. Learn more about Bollinger Bands速 <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp">here</a>.           
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Relative Strength Index (RSI)</h4>
                        <ol>The RSI is used mainly to identify the overbought or oversold conditions in the trading of a commodity. 
                        The formula used to calculate RSI is: <b>100 - 100 / (1 + RS)</b>. Note that RS is the average gain of ups during the timeframe / the loss of downs during the timeframe.
                        RSI is useful as it indicates reversals in trends, both up and down, quicker than almost every other method.
